# magimixer

The hyperaddictive magimixer (a dice game) improved my arithmetics as a kid and can still keep me and my friends occupied for hours. Generating and solving these little puzzles provides a nice case for my very first github project and phonegap app.

The objective is to create the sum of the black dices using all 5 other dices exactly once by adding, substracting, multiplying and dividing, with as many parentheses as you need.
